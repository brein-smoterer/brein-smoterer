# jenshen-trolls
The purpose of this project is to make a site that helps you make a build for your *Genshin Impact* characters.(It's purpose is
directed to the losers who, on top of not tuching grass, can't think enough to pair a strong enough waifu or husbando with a 
good toothpick, poking stick, chopstick, book or a piece of thin slices of dead tree to be able to kick grass.)

Firstly you need to select the character you want to make a build with. After that, you will see a page with all the equipable
weapons for that chatracter and posible builds for that character. In the builds you can see the most suitable weapons an artifacts...
  
The way it works is:
1.Select a character
2.Salect a build
